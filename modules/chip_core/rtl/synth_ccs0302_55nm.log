ARGUMENTS
       -to to_list
              Reports  only the paths to the named pins, ports, or clocks.  If
              you do not specify the -to option, the default is to report  the
              longest  path to an output port if the design has no timing con-
              straints.  If the design has timing constraints, the default  is
              to  report  the path with the worst slack within each path group
              if the -group option is not present.  If the  -group  option  is
              given,  the  default  is to report the path with the worst slack
              within the group specified by the -group option.

       -rise_to rise_to_list
              Same as the -to option, but applies only to paths rising at  the
              endpoint.   If  a clock object is specified, this option selects
              endpoints clocked by the named clock, but only  the  paths  cap-
              tured  by  the  rising edge of the clock at clock source, taking
              into account any logical inversions along the clock path.

       -fall_to fall_to_list
              Same as the -to option, but applies only to paths falling at the
              endpoint.   If  a clock object is specified, this option selects
              endpoints clocked by the named clock, but only  the  paths  cap-
              tured by the falling edge of the clock at the clock source, tak-
              ing into account any logical inversions along the clock path.

       -from from_list
              Reports only the paths from the named pins,  ports,  or  clocks.
              If you do not specify the -from option, the default is to report
              the longest path to an output port if the design has  no  timing
              constraints.   If the design has timing constraints, the default
              is to report the path with the  worst  slack  within  each  path
              group if the -group option is not present.  If the -group option
              is given, the default is to report the path with the worst slack
              within the group specified by the -group option.

       -rise_from rise_from_list
              Same  as  the  -from option, except that the path must rise from
              the objects specified.  If a clock  object  is  specified,  this
              option  selects startpoints clocked by the named clock, but only
              the paths launched by the rising edge of the clock at the  clock
              source,  taking  into  account  any logical inversions along the
              clock path.

       -fall_from fall_from_list
              Same as the -from option, except that the path  must  fall  from
              the  objects  specified.   If  a clock object is specified, this
              option selects startpoints clocked by the named clock, but  only
              the paths launched by the falling edge of the clock at the clock
              source, taking into account any  logical  inversions  along  the
              clock path.

       -through through_list
              Reports  only  paths that pass through the named pins, ports, or
              clocks.  If you do not specify the -through option, the  default
              is  to  report  the longest path to an output port if the design
              has no timing constraints.  If the design does have timing  con-
              straints, the default is to report the path with the worst slack
              within each path group if the -group option is not present.   If
              the  -group  option  is given, the default is to report the path
              with the worst slack within the group specified  by  the  -group
              option.

              If  you  specify  the  -through  option  only one time, the tool
              reports only the paths that travel through one or  more  of  the
              objects  in  the list.  You can specify the -through option more
              than one time in one command invocation.  For  a  discussion  of
              the  use  of multiple -through options, see the DESCRIPTION sec-
              tion.

       -rise_through rise_through_list
              Reports only paths with a rising  transition  at  the  specified
              objects.   This  option  is similar to the -through option.  You
              can specify the -rise_through option more than  one  time  in  a
              single   command  invocation.   For  a  discussion  of  multiple
              -through, -rise_through,  and  -fall_through  options,  see  the
              DESCRIPTION section.

       -fall_through fall_through_list
              Reports  only  paths  with a falling transition at the specified
              objects.  This option is similar to the  -through  option.   You
              can  specify  the  -fall_through  option more than one time in a
              single  command  invocation.  For  a  discussion   of   multiple
              -through,  -rise_through,  and  -fall_through  options,  see the
              DESCRIPTION section.

       -exclude exclude_list
              Prevents reporting of all data paths from/through/to  the  named
              pins, ports, nets, and cell instances. Any data path that starts
              from, contains, or ends on a  listed  object  is  excluded  from
              reporting.   If  you  specify  a  cell instance, data paths that
              include any pin of that cell instance are excluded. This  option
              has higher precedence than the -from, -through, -to, and similar
              options.

              The exclusion does not apply  to  clock  paths,  even  when  the
              -path_type  full_clock  or -path_type full_clock_expanded option
              is  used.  It  does  not  apply  to  borrowing  path  from   the
              -trace_latch_borrow option.

              This option is not applied to clock pins.

       -rise_exclude rise_exclude_list
              Same as the -exclude option, but applies only to paths rising at
              the named pins, ports, nets, and cell instances.

       -fall_exclude fall_exclude_list
              Same as the -exclude option, but applies only to  paths  falling
              at the named pins, ports, nets, and cell instances.

       -path_type short | full | full_clock | full_clock_expanded | only | end
              Specifies  how to display the timing path.  By default, the full
              path is displayed.  The following values are valid:

               o If full_clock is specified, the  report  is  similar  to  the
                report you get with full but also reports the full clock paths
                for propagated clocks.

               o If full_clock_expanded is specified, the report is similar to
                the  report  you get with full_clock but also reports the full
                clock path from the primary clock  to  the  related  generated
                clock source.

               o  If  short  is  specified, only startpoints and endpoints are
                displayed.

               o If only is specified, only the path is displayed without  the
                accompanying required-time and slack calculation.

               o  If  end  is  specified,  the report has a column format that
                shows one line for each path, showing only the  endpoint  path
                total, required-time, and slack.

       -delay_type min | min_rise | min_fall | max | max_rise | max_fall
              Specifies the path type at the endpoint.  The default is max.

       -nworst paths_per_endpoint
              Specifies  the  maximum  number of paths to report per endpoint.
              The default is 1, which reports only the single worst path  end-
              ing at a given endpoint.

       -max_paths max_path_count
              Specifies  the  number  of  paths  to  report  per path group by
              default, or the number of paths to report for the  whole  design
              if  the  timing_report_fast_mode  variable  is  set to true. The
              default is 1.

       -input_pins
              Shows input pins in the path report.  The  default  is  to  show
dc_shell> 
dc_shell> exit
